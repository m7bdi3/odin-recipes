    <h2>Grilled Chicken Margherita</h2>
    <pr>Grilled marinated chicken, topped with melted mozzarella, pesto, and cherry tomatoes makes a delicious summer meal! Serve with rice or angel hair pasta.</pr>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
<h2><ol>Ingredients:</ol></h2>
        <ol>4 (6 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts
        </ol>
        <ol> ¼ cup olive oil</ol>
        <ol>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</ol>
        <ol>1 clove garlic, minced</ol>
        <ol>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</ol>
        <ol>½ teaspoon salt</ol>
        <ol>1 cup halved cherry tomatoes</ol>
        <ol>4 fresh basil leaves, minced</ol>
        <ol>1 teaspoon lemon juice
        </ol>
        <ol>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</ol>
        <ol>4 slices mozzarella cheese
        </ol>
        <ol>¼ cup basil pesto</ol>
        <br>
        <br>
<h2><ol>Steps:</ol></h2>
<ol>
        <li>Gently pound chicken breasts into even thickness using the smooth side of a meat mallet, about 1/2 inch thick. Place chicken into a resealable plastic bag.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic, Italian seasoning, and salt in a small bowl. Pour over chicken, coat evenly, and marinate for 4 to 8 hours.
        </li> 
        <br>
        <li>Combine cherry tomatoes, basil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
        </li> 
        <br>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat; lightly oil the grate.</li> 
        <br>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade and grill with the lid closed for 4 minutes. Flip chicken and grill an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Top each breast with a slice of mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon of pesto, then top with cherry tomatoes. Close lid on grill and continue grilling until cheese is melted and chicken is no longer pink inside, about 3 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Using a spatula, carefully remove chicken to a serving platter.</li>
